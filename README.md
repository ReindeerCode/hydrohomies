## Description:
Jim's Water Supply Company! A blog site for hydrohomies to review and rate carbonated water. 
The front end modeled after the untapped website. Users could choose from different water brand options, request a new brand be added to the site, and also rate the brands. Users may also be able to click on a button that links them to Amazon and purchase the product. The backend would be tables of brands divided up based on brand, price, flat/carbonated, and flavor.
